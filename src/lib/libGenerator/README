Following is the README from LisaEm 1.3.0 which has a proper library version
of libGenerator, the stuff here is actually *NOT* a useable libGenerator,
but rather the lisaem-1.2.6 CPU code retrofitted to work with the build
system from 1.3.0, and is not suitable for use outside of LisaEm.

The proper 1.3.0 libGenerator code is suitable for use in other emus,
however I've not been able to fix its bugs yet.
===========================================================================
This directory contains libGenerator, a Motorola 68000 CPU emulation core.

libGenerator is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.
libGenerator is based on Generator, a Sega Genesis Emulator.
